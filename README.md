Simple and efficient
====================

When started, the application icon appears in menu bar.

• Use 'Show/Hide Desktop Icons' (Cmd-Opt-S) to hide icons (requires restarting Finder)

• Use 'Show/Hide External Display' (Cmd-Opt-E) to dim secondary display(s) to 95% dark

• Use 'Show/Hide Notication Center' (Cmd-Opt-E) to enable/disable notification center


Protects your data
==================
Main idea behind this app is to hide your Desktop clutter and private data on presentation. On a feature request, it 
hides any notifications by disabling the Notification Center temporarily.


Ask for your feature
====================
Maybe your feature or idea could be implemented tonight! Asking a question costs nothing.
